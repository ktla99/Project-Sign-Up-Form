# Project-Sign-Up-Form

Project Sign Up Form was made with the use of HTML, an external CSS and an external JavaScript.

This project was the product of my compounded knowledge of manipulating DOM and implementing properties of JavaScript. 

This project was fun to do as it had a guide to follow but also allowed creative freedom in the design of the page, fonts, and many other aspects. The most difficult part of the project was integrating the validation of the functions to make sure the input data are correct.
